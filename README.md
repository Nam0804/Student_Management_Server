# Student Management Server

## Overview

Student Management Server is the backend service for the Student Management System. Built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, it provides a robust API for managing students, teachers, courses, and other related data. The server handles authentication, authorization, and data processing, and exposes RESTful endpoints for the client-side application to interact with.

- **Database Management**: Efficient data storage and retrieval using MongoDB.
- **Security**: Implemented security practices like password hashing and JWT tokens.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords.
